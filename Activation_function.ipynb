    "3)Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. Here are some key ways in which activation functions impact neural network training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction of Non-Linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the model, allowing neural networks to learn and represent complex patterns in data. Without non-linear activation functions, the entire network would behave like a linear model, limiting its ability to capture intricate relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Flow and Backpropagation: During the training process, neural networks use a technique called backpropagation to adjust the weights and biases based on the error between predicted and actual outputs. The choice of activation function affects the gradient flow during backpropagation. Activation functions with well-defined gradients, such as the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent (tanh), make it easier for the model to learn and converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Vanishing and Exploding Gradients: Some activation functions, like the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, are prone to vanishing gradients or exploding gradients. Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients become very small, hindering the training of deep networks. Exploding gradients occur when the gradients become very large, leading to unstable training. Activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) help mitigate these issues by allowing a more stable flow of gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity and Activation Spreading: ReLU and its variants promote sparsity by turning off some neurons during training, which can be beneficial for memory and computational efficiency. Activation spreading refers to how the output of a neuron is distributed across the network. Proper activation functions can help maintain a balanced and effective spread of activations, preventing issues like dead neurons (neurons that never activate) or saturated neurons (neurons that are always active)."

    "Output Range: The sigmoid function outputs values between 0 and 1. This is useful for binary classification problems where the goal is to predict probabilities that can be interpreted as class probabilities (e.g., the probability of belonging to class 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "S-shaped Curve: The sigmoid function produces an S-shaped curve. For very negative inputs, the output is close to 0, and for very positive inputs, the output is close to 1. As the input approaches 0, the output is approximately 0.5.\n",

    "Output Interpretability: The output of the sigmoid function can be interpreted as a probability, which is particularly useful for binary classification problems. It indicates the likelihood of an instance belonging to a certain class.\n",

    "Vanishing Gradients: One of the main drawbacks of the sigmoid function is the \"vanishing gradients\" problem. As the input becomes very negative or very positive, the gradient of the sigmoid approaches zero, which can hinder the learning of deep neural networks during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Saturation: The sigmoid function saturates when the input is far from 0. This means that for extreme values of the input, the gradient of the sigmoid becomes very small, leading to slow or stalled learning. This is related to the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

    "Not Zero-Centered: The outputs of the sigmoid function are not zero-centered, which can cause issues in weight updates during optimization. It may lead to slower convergence or undesired zigzagging during training."

    "Advantages and Disadvantages:\n",

    "Sparse Activation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid: Sigmoid activations can produce outputs that are all in a similar range, leading to a dense activation pattern.\n",
